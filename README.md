# JavaScript

JavaScript can be integrated into an HTML document in three ways: inline, internal, and external. These methods differ in where the JavaScript code is placed and how it is linked to the HTML.

**Inline JavaScript**

**Internal JavaScript**

**External JavaScript**

**Inline JavaScript:**

Inline JavaScript refers to code embedded directly within HTML elements using event handler attributes (e.g., onclick, onmouseover). 

**Placement:** Inside the opening tag of a specific HTML element.

**Internal JavaScript:**

Internal JavaScript involves placing the code within <script> tags directly inside the HTML document itself. 

**Placement:** Within <script> and </script> tags, typically in the <head> or at the end of the <body> section of the HTML document.

**External JavaScript:**

External JavaScript is the recommended method for most projects. The code is written in a separate file with a .js extension and then linked to the HTML document. 

**Placement:** In a separate .js file (e.g., script.js). A reference to this file is placed in the HTML using a <script> tag with the src attribute.
